        <h2> Steak </h2>
            <p>I love a good steak, especially when it is cooked medium rare </p>
            <p> Beef is a good-tasting and nutritious food item, and steaks are the favorite of most people. A good steak is juicy, tender, loaded with flavor, and has a minimum amount of fat. 
            </p>
            <p> 
                Lean is the cherry-red part of the meat. The fat is the white part of the meat. Fat is a waste item on a steak. It is cut off and thrown away. So a good steak doesn't have much fat on the outside or between the muscles. However, there is a special kind of fat that helps meat be juicy and full of flavor. </p>
