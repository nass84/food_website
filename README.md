Learn HTML and CSS ðŸ–¥
Let's get coding! HTML and CSS are two very important languages when it comes to the web. At marksheet.io you will find a tutorial with four sections; Web, HTML, CSS and Sass. Work through the first three sections and we will come back to Sass later in the course. The Web section should should help you embed what you've learnt from the Crash Course Computer Science videos, the HTML and CSS sections are a treasure trove of great information on putting together a website.

Whilst you are going through those tutorials use VS Code to practice, and practice what you've learnt by making a simple website. It can be about anything, but if you need a starting point then make a website all about your favorite food.
